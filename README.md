You can check out the repository and explore the following projects:

### birds

Simple rules applied to individual objects can lead to complex collective phenomena. In this project, I use OpenGL to render a "flock" of squares and try to coax some emergent behavior out of them. With just the right balance of attractive / repulsive interactions, as well a bit of goal-seeking, some pretty neat behavior emerges. You can watch the video that goes with this project here: https://youtu.be/UJc1-sj8cOg.

### sudoku

Sudoku is a number puzzle with a straightforward goal: given some input arrangement of numbers in a 9x9 grid, fill in the blanks such that each row, column, and 3x3 sub-block contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. Much of the logic for completing Sudoku puzzles is straightforward and easily encodable in a simple computer program - so that is what this project does! The Python solver is capable of solving 74 of the 75 included sample puzzles. See https://www.chem.fsu.edu/~deprince/fun_stuff/sudoku/ for more details.
